## Base Laravel Admin

Just a basic Laravel 4.1 install with a admin site/dashboard using Bootstrap 3.0.3

For those (like me) who set up lots of small systems to manage different things, this is my starting point.

It is just a base install with an admin 'dashboard' with simple login/logout and that is it.
